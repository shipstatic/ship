# Shipstatic CLI Usage Guide

This guide shows how to use the Shipstatic CLI for deploying static websites directly from your terminal. The CLI provides a simple, resource-based interface with automatic configuration loading and comprehensive error handling.

## Features
- **Zero configuration**: Automatic config loading from environment/files
- **Optimized bundle size**: 25KB CLI bundle
- **Resource-based commands**: Intuitive `ship deployments create` syntax
- **Built-in shortcuts**: Quick `ship ./path` deployments and `ship whoami`
- **Rich terminal output:**
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Colored error messaging
  - Structured JSON output option

## Installation

### Local Development (Pre-release)
Since the package is not yet publicly available, you can install and use the CLI locally:

```sh
# Navigate to the ship directory
cd ship

# Install dependencies and build
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Link globally (makes 'ship' command available)
pnpm link --global
```

After linking, the `ship` command should be available in your terminal.

### Standard Installation (When Published)
```sh
npm install -g @shipstatic/ship
# or
pnpm add -g @shipstatic/ship
```

## Configuration

The CLI automatically loads configuration from (in priority order):

### 1. Command Line Options
```sh
ship ./dist -u https://api.shipstatic.com -k ship-your-api-key
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```sh
export SHIP_API_KEY=ship-your-api-key
export SHIP_API_URL=https://api.shipstatic.com  # optional
ship ./dist
```

### 3. Configuration Files

#### `.shiprc` file (JSON format)
Create a `.shiprc` file in your project directory:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "ship-your-api-key",
  "apiUrl": "https://api.shipstatic.com"
}
```

#### `package.json` configuration
Add a `ship` section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "ship": {
    "apiKey": "ship-your-api-key",
    "apiUrl": "https://api.shipstatic.com"
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- API keys must start with `ship-` and be 69 characters total
- Only `apiKey` and `apiUrl` are supported in configuration files
- The CLI searches for config files in the current working directory

## Quick Start

```sh
# Get help and see all commands
ship

# Deploy your site (shortcut)
ship ./dist

# Check your account
ship whoami

# Test connectivity

## Error Handling

The CLI provides clear error messages for common issues:

```sh
# Missing API key
$ ship ./dist
error authentication failed

# Invalid path
$ ship ./nonexistent
error ./nonexistent path does not exist

# Network issues
$ ship ping
error network error

# JSON error output
$ ship ./dist --json
{
  "error": "authentication failed"
}

# No color error output
$ ship ./dist --no-color
error authentication failed
```

## Configuration Priority

When multiple configuration sources are present, the CLI uses this priority order:

1. **Command line flags** (highest priority)
2. **Environment variables**
3. **`.shiprc` file**
4. **`package.json` ship section**
5. **Default values** (lowest priority)
